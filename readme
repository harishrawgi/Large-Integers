-----------------------------------------------Implementation of Large Integers--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Basic Introduction
---------------------

All the src code has been written to implement Large integers. The idea was to implement Large integers using structures and pointers
in form of a linked list. This allows for arbirtrarily large integers. The base chosen for the implementation was 1000.
Two operations, namely addition and multiplication of large integers have been implemented along with an expression evaluation module.

2. Salient Features
------------

This implementation of Large Integers has the following features:

- The code is as generic as possible and uses only singly linked list
- The code is fast as it uses two pointers LSB and MSB. These two pointers allow for quick addition of digits
  on either end of the integer. This saves a lot of time while performing operations which otherwise would have been used
  for iterating everytime a new digit was to be added at one end.
- BASE of the large integer has been kept as 1000, but this is again generic and can be changed in the header file. But the input module
  assumes digits of 4 characters. This can be changed to accomodate higher bases.
- The input module has been designed with specific instructions in mind as per the assignment
- The code has an expression evaluation module, which is able to perform addition and multiplication from left to right

3. Code description
-------------------

The src code is divided into three main components:

A. LargeIntegers: This component has the crux of the code, with various functions implemented as per the Assignment.
                  There are also some helper functions which are used while dealing with large integers.
                  The description of each function is present in both the header and Implementation files just above the function.
                  There are some complicated functions which take multiple inputs and also produce an output. The description for
                  such functions are mentioned in details.

                  This component also defines the basic structures which have been used to represent digits and the
                  whole large integer as a linked list of digits. These are the structures that have been used everywhere in the code.

B. Main: This component acts as the client side and has a menu driven approach, which will allow the user to repeatedly enter
          expressions of large integers and see output over standard output.

C. Utils: This component has a few general purpose functions which have been implemented as per requirement. Example: Max function.


4. Testing
----------

The client program allows the user to enter different expressions and test the code. Some sample test cases with expected output
are already present in the "testcases" folder. These testcases can be executed using simple linux redirection.


5. Points to be noted
----------------------

- Please follow the input guidelines, as the program would not allow for any deviation from the input format
- The large integers are unsigned
